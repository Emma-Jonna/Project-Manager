# Project Description
The final project
This was my final assignment for school and our task was to learn something new, so i choose to use .NET to create my website.
The background for my idea was to create a webbsite were i can keep track of all my current creative project in one place, whether I had all the materials, when they were started, etc.
The reason I chose .NET was because i really liked working with C# so I wanted to learn how to make a website with it and not just console apps.
